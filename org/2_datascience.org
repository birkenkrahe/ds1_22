- Vast, new, hard to define, highly interdisciplinary field
- 'Data science' is the science of "that what is given" (data)
- My definition: *data + code + stats = story*

  #+begin_notes
  In this lesson, I am giving an oveRview[fn:1] of several aspects of
  data science. Though young as a declared field (2012), it is a field
  both ill-defined and (or perhaps because of it) vast and hard to pin
  down. This outline will be applied rather than scholarly, focusing
  on applications and practice rather than concepts or theory.

  In its name, "data science" carries both aspects of science and
  craft: the 'science' part is responsible for the modus operandi,
  which is informed by statistics and math, systematic and logically
  rigorous. The 'data' part relates mostly to craft: the ability to
  extract insights from data using computing tools. Most data
  scientists are more occupied by and with the craft part than with
  the science part (cp. [[kozyrkov_2018][Kozyrkov 2018]]).

  Hence, data science so far is a typical support science. It supports
  other, more established disciplines in the natural and in the social
  sciences. Prominent examples are: economics, genomics, and
  epidemiology.

  The need to use the data "to tell a story" sets data science apart
  from both traditional data craft and science. It is the reason why
  visualization techniques and theory ("grammar of graphics",
  cp. [[sarkar_2018][Sarkar 2018]]) play such an important role.

  I would argue that data science is most successful when supporting
  fields that themselves are interdisciplinary and therefore need a
  higher degree of communication across different cultures of science
  and practice. This is the quasi-definition that I came up with while
  preparing these notes:

  [RAW] *DATA* + [LITERATE] *CODE* + [APPLIED] *Stats* = [DECISION] *STORY*

  Why? Because data always come in "raw" form and have to be wrestled
  with. To do this, you need to be able to code (a little anyway). But
  in order to achieve the main goal, namely add value,
  process-oriented science has to come in, most importantly through
  systematic methods and the accompanying processes, to validate
  insights and help communicate results. Well, so far, so good.

  In the following lecture, I will focus on four aspects of data
  science: the popularity it currently enjoys (and has enjoyed for the
  past 10 years), the skills required to "do data science", and the
  processes or activities involved in doing it. We will look at each
  of these with some examples.

  At the end of each chapter, you'll find a quick challenge ("youR
  tuRn"[fn:2]) - this is usually just a question related to the
  text. Sample answers and hints to challenges are gathered [[challenges][at the end
  of the document.]]

* WAYS TO EXPLORE POPULARITY

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px
#+Caption: Google doodle 4th July 2022
[[../img/2_4th_july.gif]]

- *Search* (how? where?)
- Find relevant *models* (how?)
- Generate *primary* data (how?)
- Use *secondary* data (how?)

*Question: Can you think of any issues with these methods?*

#+begin_notes
1) Search - where? How?
   - Google (Scholar) - disadvantage of Google searches?
   - arxiv.org
   - data science blogs (R-Blogger, Towards Data Science, Analytics
     Vidhya, R Weekly, DataCamp)
2) Find relevant models - what is that?
   - Metaphors are models
   - Mathematical model may not exist
   - Example for models?
3) Generate primary data
   - Which measures are used?
   - Which methods are used?
4) Look secondary data
   - public?
   - Valid?
   - How do you validate?

Example: social networking analysis - Predicting Tie Strength
(2009). Paper: https://1drv.ms/b/s!AhEvK3qWokrvqz6uRFcluk1LEOW5

This paper uses a model to distinguish between weak and strong ties
(with over 85% accuracy) based on a parametrization (= features to
establish splitting the data) and a linear model (= assumption that
the predictive variables are linearly correlated). Data science is
used to address questions hidden in the data, such as how users
relate to one another in social media, how they behave, perhaps
even why they do what they do (= statistical inference).

- 2012: Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century
- 2022: Data Scientist: Still the "Sexiest Job of the 21st Century"?

*What do you think has changed since 2012?*

#+begin_notes
In the graph from trends.google.com, "numbers represent search
interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given
region [worldwide] and time [since logging trends in 2004]." The trend
increased is noticeable. It peaked in March 2022 ([[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1658887200?hl=en-US&tz=300&date=all&q=data+science&sni=3][Source: Google
Trends]]).

In October 2012, almost 10 years ago, Davenport and Patil published
"Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century" and put the
term on the map.

*What has changed since 2012?*

1) (According to Davenport/Patil, 2022)
   - *Demand* in 2012 restricted to a few cities, startups, tech firms
   - Data scientists in 2012 were *science PhDs*, exceptional at math,
     who knew how to code
   - Data scientists now need to develop *AI models*
   - By 2019, postings on career site Indeed had risen by 256%
   - Projected 15% increase from 2019 to 2029
   - Lack of "data-driven cultures" (no use for data insights)
   - Turnover is high (data scientists often don't stay long)
   - Data science is better institutionalized (= widely accepted)
   - Diversification and proliferation of roles (many skills needed)
   - Changes in technology (like AutoML, MLOps tools)
   - Need for an ethical dimension widely acknowledged (politicized)

2) Other changes that might have affected data science:
   - COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022)
   - Rise of cloud computing, quantum computing, deep learning
   - Political divide deepened (immigration, abortion, gun laws)

* WHAT ARE DATA SCIENCE SKILLS?
#+name: fig:def

[[../img/2_ds_skills.jpg]]

*Can you give some examples for any of these skills?*

- What do you know for example if you have "domain knowledge"?
- Which professional activities correspond to "math and stats"?
- What kind of "programming" would you have to do?

#+begin_notes
The three skill areas in figure [[fig:def]] from [[robinson_nolis_2020][Robinson/Nolis (2020)]]
give rise to different tasks and problem settings:

| Skill     | Sample area      | Sample activity        | Sample analysis         |
|-----------+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------|
| Domain    | Marketing        | Analyze customer data  | What do customers like? |
| knowledge | Education        | Learner data           | How did students learn? |
|           | Finance          | Investment data        | Which stock performed?  |
|-----------+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------|
| Coding &  | R, Python, SQL   | Analzye/automate/query | Count customers by type |
| databases | Cloud computing  | Share data and code    | Work in virtual teams   |
|           | RStudio, Emacs   | Improve your workflow  | Create a notebook[fn:4] |
|           | Package creation | Write new functions    | Distribute package      |
|-----------+------------------+------------------------+-------------------------|
| Maths &   | Data structure   | Data wrangling         | Check data [[https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/tidyverse.html][tidyness]]     |
| stats     | Model building   | Linear [[https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/regression.html][regression]]      | Fit line graph to data  |
|           | Distribution     | Check significance     | Apply t-test[fn:5]      |


Between two of these areas each are application areas:

1) Domain knowledge and statistics support *decision science*. See
   [[https://medium.com/@ibobriakov/data-science-vs-decision-science-infographic-7ad6e16698d][infographic]] (source: [[bobriakov_2019][Bobriakov 2019]]).

2) Data analytics are the result of applying *database programming*
   (e.g. with SQL) to domain knowledge problems(this is also
   sometimes called *'business intelligence'* or BI).

3) Programming, maths and statistics give rise to various machine
   learning (ML) techniques concerned in particular with *prediction*
   and automatic pattern recognition.

#+begin_notes
1. Problem solving skills:
   - Understand the problem: the conditions, the unknowns, the
     data. Of these, I am particularly good with data.
   - Design a plan of attack (e.g. by modeling - abstracting from
     the details to identify one or more routes or options)
   - Carry out the plan of attack: this is execution. Probably my
     least favorite part (often, when I see the solution path, I
     get bored). But I can do it, and it's satisfying to finish
     something.
   - Look back, review and discuss your solution. I am especially
     good at this type of postmortem analysis - it's probably what
     I use most when it comes to teaching stuff.
2. Computational thinking skills
   - 10 programming languages - recommended: SQL and R
3. Data literacy skills
   - Wikipedia definition is not bad: "Ability to understand,
     create, and communicate data as information." (I.e. structured
     data)
   - Use of visualization and storytelling techniques
   - Business process modeling
4. Communication skills
   - team / leadership experience
5. Tool skills
   - I love tools
   - In my courses usually use about 20 different IT tools

#+begin_notes
Tip: when you come across products you don't know, make it a habit to
look them up - knowing the names and what they stand for will help you
anchor yourself in anything you read, and the most important products,
which are most talked about, are often talked about for a reason -
e.g. because they represent an innovation and/or an advantage. By
knowing the products, you can also learn something about the
innovation. This dependency on products also shows that both computer
and data science are crafts.

* WHAT IS "FRANKENSTEIN'S DATA SCIENTIST" MADE OF?
#+NAME: fig:frankenstein
#+ATTR_html: :width 600px

#+begin_notes
"Frankenstein's monster" (based on the novel by "Frankenstein, or
The Modern Prometheus", by Mary Shelley, 1818) is used in
figure [[fig:frankenstein]] as a metaphor for a working data scientist. it
is a rich metaphor with many connotations.

- "Eyes": experience with detecting data patterns. to do this
  actually with your eyes is unlikely - you need some tools for
  that, but you also need experience to know which tools will
  work. example: ~head(dataset)~ only prints the first 6 rows of a
  dataset giving you an idea of the type of data in the dataset.
- "Heart": passion for and creativity with data. "passion" is
  perhaps more relevant for the data's origin and for what you can
  do with well interpreted data - namely change the world! example:
  hans rosling's gapminder animations (and his passionate
  storytelling, demonstrated e.g. in Hans Rosling's TED videos.
- "Hands": domain knowledge gained by working in an industry for
  years, supported by activity in communities like [[https://www.infoworld.com/article/3564164/kaggle-where-data-scientists-learn-and-compete.html][kaggle]] (owned by
  google since 2017), which hosts datasets, notebooks and ml
  competitions.
- "Brain": analytical mindset and knowledge of analysis tools
  (none of the tools mentioned here, hadoop, spark, [[https://hive.apache.org/][hive]] - a data
  warehouse - or [[https://www.sas.com/][sas]] - another statistical analysis workbench - are
  necessary - they are merely nice to know). how do you know that
  you have this kind of brain? e.g. if you enjoy getting
  quantitative (number-based) answers and if you like visualizations
  of complex or complicated data (like the gapminder data). also, if
  you like programming or maths, you've likely got such a brain.
- "Mouth": communication with colleagues - but not only. in
  fact, especially being able to communicate with people who are not
  your colleagues (so they are perhaps very different from you) is
  key. this is another way of saying that you need to be able to
  "tell a story" after data analysis (e.g. [[prevos][Prevos 2020]]).
- "Feet": data science is a very fast-moving technology field,
  especially its "machine learning" offshoot (which is not part of
  this course) - cp. [[kozyrkov_2019][Kozyrkov 2019]]. you need to keep on top of the available
  information. at the same time, there is too much to take in and
  digest - this means that it is very important to have a sound
  understanding of the foundations of data science.

#+attr_html: :width 300px
#+NAME: fig:jobs
[[../img/2_ds_demand1.png]]

#+begin_notes
The value of statistics like shown in figure [[fig:jobs]] depends on the
exact definitions of the job, on the ability of business to recruit
exactly for what they want etc. I have personally not spoken to any
recruiter about this - I only read career-related blogs and looked
at statistics like these (published by [[https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/][Berkeley School of
Information 2020]], a site that is interested in attracting data
science students, therefore highly biased). However, as a rule, you
can never go wrong with growing your skill stack, especially with
regard to STEM skills, and within these especially with regard to
your ability to analyse data quantitatively - which is what data
science boils down to. For more details on "data science careers",
see [[robinson_nolis_2020][Robinson/Nolis (2020)]].

Mathematics, especially statistics, programming and databases are
the skill-based disciplines that you need to master. Having said
that: "mastering" could easily take not one, but several life times,
and you need to begin somewhere. If you do this in earnest, you'll
soon find that you start learning faster and faster the more
connections with what you already know you can make.] Here is a
(free) book called, incidentally, "[[https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf][Foundations of Data Science]]"
([[blum_2015][Blum et al 2015, 466 p.]]). It includes some geometry, graph theory,
linear algebra, markov chains, and a variety of algorithms for
"massive data problems" like streaming, sketching and sampling.

Introductory DataCamp courses on data science "for everyone" (that is,
without being tied to one of the three dominant languages - Python, R,
or SQL), contain a job profile section to help users find their
professional data science niche.

The figure [[fig:prof]] shows four such profiles from a 2020 course. What
is notably missing here is the maths and/or CS or software engineering
knowledge required or desirable to fill these roles. But there are
also people who say that you best come to a firm as a general-purpose
computer scientist and then learn any of these on the job depending on
the needs and the available experience.

- *Data analytics*: explorative or explanatory [DSC 302 fall'22]
- *Statistics*: few important decisions with high uncertainty [DSC 482 fall'22]
- *Machine learning*: many decisions involving big data [DSC 305 spring'23]

#+begin_notes
The cartoon in figure [[fig:decision]] is by Google's head of "decision
intelligence", [[kozyrkov_2019][Cassie Kozyrkov (2018)]]. She has a specific,
business- and decision-oriented idea of the purpose of data
science, which I share: data science is there to help you make
decisions. The option tree shown distinguishes three sub-fields of
data science: data analytics, statistics and machine learning. It
asks if you're "making decisions" at the start (many, few, hardly
any), it quickly focuses on the type of data (few vs big) and the
'uncertainty' and 'importance' of the decisions. This is still a
data-centric, not a decision-centric taxonomy. A focus on the
latter would allow for many more options (e.g. strategic
vs. tactical, organizational vs. managerial, routine
vs. exceptional decisions etc.) Hence, for decision science, this
kind of breakdown is not very useful.

The dominance of "big data" has also been doubted, especially when
it comes to making (business) decisions. "Small [not big] data"
([[saklani_2017][Saklani, 2017]]) and "thick [qualitative, descriptive] data" may be
just as good depending on what you want to know. The article by
[[chiu_2020][Chiu (2020)]] is a bit of a history hack (in the scholarly sense) but
it raises some good points.

Brandon Rohrer, [then] a data scientist at Microsoft, has addressed
this question in a 3-part series of short articles ([[rohrer_2015][Rohrer, 2015a,
2015b, 2015c]]). His examples are a more specific, especially because
he also says which family of algorithms match which type of
data-related question. It is too early for us to discuss his
taxonomy but at the end of the course, you should have a better
idea about what you can do with data science tools.

*...youR tuRn:* Think about any decision you make - what are the
steps you go through? Do they amount to a "data science adventure"
as shown in the figure [[fig:decision]] - why (or why not)? [[challenge_decisions][(Hint)]]

#+begin_notes
All system components continuously write data protocols in the form
of simple event logs, which you can view easily on Linux systems
[[https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/viewing-and-monitoring-log-files#1-overview][e.g. on Ubuntu]]. Check available system logs with ~ls -la
/var/log/~. Figure [[fig-log]] shows a sample section from my
computer's system log in ~/var/log/syslog~.

This excerpt shows how and when the computer clock was set remotely,
and the starting of various servers and one socket where my mobile
phone ("Xperia L2") was connected.

The language we're about to use in this course (and in the follow
up course on machine learning), R, is well suited for rapid
interactive exploration of datasets such as this one. The two
immediately relevant problem areas are "text mining" (notice that
all system files are human-readable to aid debugging), and "time
series analysis" (event logs are time series).

Text mining is considered a part of "Natural Language Processing",
and Time Series Analysis is also really important in finance,
e.g. when analysing portfolio performance.

A separate technique (not immediately part of an R programming
course) is "process mining".

#+begin_notes
Figure [[fig:process]] shows a process that begins with raw data. Such data are
usually not formatted as "tidy" data, i.e. "each row represents one
observation and columns represent the different variables available
for each of these observations" ([[irizarry_2020][Irizarry 2020]]). This is also the
tabular format, which is usual for storing data in relational
databases for analysis with SQL.

Once we have tidy data, an (often repeated) sub-process begins:
"transform" refers to any operation on the dataset that helps us
understand the data better. Depending on the size of the data tables,
we will use different methods of visualization to make underlying
structure visible. But visualization does not always have to be
graphical - it could also be making a table, or creating a metaphor.

<<challenges>>
** Popularity  <<challenge_popular>>
Check out the seminal article by [[davenport_2012][Davenport/Patil 2012.]] (At least)
one answer is in there.
** Skills <<challenge_skills>>
Recently, an MBA student asked me these same questions and here is
my answer: "[[https://1drv.ms/b/s!AhEvK3qWokrvhPhyO8vS3nRXWah9jA][My IT Skill Stack]]". See also [[bolles][Bolles and Brooks (2021)]]
** Software <<challenge_packages>>
- [[https://d3js.org/][D3.js,]] a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on
  data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS.
- [[http://hadoop.apache.org/][Apache Hadoop,]] a "software library framework that allows for the
  distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of
  computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale
  up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering
  local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to
  deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect
  and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a
  highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of
  which may be prone to failures." (Source: Apache.org)
- [[https://www.ibm.com/analytics/hadoop/mapreduce][MapReduce]], "a programming paradigm that enables massive scalability
  across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster. As the
  processing component, MapReduce is the heart of Apache Hadoop. The
  term "MapReduce" refers to two separate and distinct tasks that
  Hadoop programs perform. The first is the map job, which takes a
  set of data and converts it into another set of data, where
  individual elements are broken down into tuples (key/value
  pairs). The reduce job takes the output from a map as input and
  combines those data tuples into a smaller set of tuples. As the
  sequence of the name MapReduce implies, the reduce job is always
  performed after the map job."  Source: IBM. See also:
  [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hadoop/hadoop_mapreduce.htm][tutorialspoint]].

- [[https://pig.apache.org/][Apache Pig]], "a platform for analyzing large data sets that
  consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
  programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these
  programs. The salient property of Pig programs is that their
  structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in
  turns enables them to handle very large data sets. At the present
  time, Pig's infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that
  produces sequences of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale
  parallel implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop
  subproject). Pig's language layer currently consists of a textual
  language called Pig Latin." Source: apache.org. [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_pig/index.htm][Tutorialspoint]].

- [[https://github.com][GitHub]] (owned by Microsoft), "a website and cloud-based service
  that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track
  and control changes to their code" (Source: [[https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/][kinsta.com]]) centered on
  the open-source version control software [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]]. There are many
  platforms like GitHub (e.g. GitLab, BitBucket, SourceForge).

  Of these applications, only Git (not GitHub) is really absolutely
  necessary for a professional data scientist working in teams. Though
  a working knowledge of the principles behind all of them will be
  very useful (especially if they come up in interviews). Hence, no
  reason to be scared.

** Your brain <<challenge_brain>>
Other terms for what we're talking about here are: "number sense"
(in maths education), or "computational thinking" (in computer
science) or, more recently, "data literacy". All of these are
relatively new concepts, so feel free to speculate and make up your
own mind! Cp. [[devlin_2017][Devlin 2017]]
** Frankenstein <<challenge_frankenstein>>

How do you feel about anything if doing it would turn you into a
monster? What kind of monster is Frankenstein (if you didn't read
the book or saw the film, I'll tell you: ugly but soulful, loveable
and capable of love, too)?  What is special about him as a monster
in mechanical terms?

** Job market <<challenge_job>>
Mathematics, especially statistics, programming and databases are
the skill-based disciplines that you need to master. Having said
that: "mastering" could easily take not one, but several life
times, and you need to begin somewhere. If you do this in earnest,
you'll soon find that you start learning faster and faster the more
connections with what you already know you can make.] Here is a
(free) book called, incidentally, "[[https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf][Foundations of Data Science]]"
([[blum_2015][Blum et al 2015, 466 p.]]). It includes some geometry, graph theory,
linear algebra, markov chains, and a variety of algorithms for
"massive data problems" like streaming, sketching and sampling.
** Decisions <<challenge_decisions>>
The figure (like the underlying article) targets business decisions
more than everyday decisions. For business decisions, taxonomies
exist, which are generally a lot more complicated than shown here,
see e.g. [[scherpereel][Scherpereel 2006]].

** Process <<challenge_process>>
On the surface, Wing's "Data Life Cycle" (2019) has a few more
steps (and it is also not a "cycle") - it does not use the
artificial (technical) term "tidy" but instead terms that can more
easily be understood by practitioners outside of data
science. Modeling is not addressed by Wing but instead she puts
"management" at the center of the process, right between
data-centric and (business) process-centric categories. Another
related process model you may have heard of is the "[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Design_Thinking_process_in_the_Chapters_Dialogue_project.png][design
thinking" process]], which plays an important role in innovation and
when solving so-called "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem][wicked problems]]".

** Summary <<challenge_davenport>>
"The ability to write code" is still the "most basic, universal skill"
for a data scientist - which is why learning R is the focus of this
introductory course. There are many data science programs at
universities now - often offered as minors or as Masters programs for
people trained already in maths, computer science, or fields with
obvious and current data science applications (like biology). The
understanding of a data scientist as a hybrid professional is still
very rudimentary.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] "oveRview" is a joke, not a mistake. Capitalizing the letter
"r" in a seemingly random fashion is a common in-joke in the R
community. Adding and/or capitalizing the letter "r" is also used to
name R software packages, as in: [[https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/07/11/introducing-learnr/][~learnr~]], [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html][~magrittr~]], or [[https://github.com/matloff/fasteR][~fasteR~]].

[fn:2] Norman Matloff used this title for small challenges throughout
his excellent [[https://github.com/matloff/fasteR#firstr][short course on R]], and I have borrowed and "R-ified" it.

[fn:3]Notice that this list amounts to a visualization, too, because
it suggests an ordering, which is supported by the language: "big
data" sounds like it should be at the top. In fact, "data science"
takes the top spot, and both BI and Software Engineering were a lot
more popular in the past.

[fn:4] A data science notebook is a "literate programming"
artifact. This concept goes back to 1984 ([[knuth_1984][Knuth 1984]]). Today, there are
plenty of commercial notebook implementations for many different
programming languages (see [[myers][Myers 2020]] "primer").

[fn:5] "A t-test is a type of inferential statistic used to determine
if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups,
which may be related in certain features." ([[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/t-test.asp][Source]])

business program at the [[https://www.berlin-professional-school.de/en/][Berlin Professional School]].
