* README

- DSC 105 covers the basics of data science with R, simple
  visualization and productivity tools
- We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
  extension, and Org-mode for literate programming
- For details on objectives, audience, grading, schedule, check the
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1/blob/piHome/org/syllabus.org][syllabus]] or the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][FAQ]] on GitHub.
- This file contains a (dynamically updated) agenda for each session
  as well as some content.
- You can also look at [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1/blob/piHome/org/agenda.org][the agenda on GitHub]].

* INTRODUCTION TO THE TEXTBOOK
#+attr_html: :width 200px
#+caption: Cover of Book of R (Davies, 2016)
[[../img/bookofR.png]]

- R is /FOSS/ with focus on stats and graphics
- Davies' "[[https://nostarch.com/bookofr][Book of R]]" is extensive (832p.)
- You don't have to read along but it might help
- Many other tutorials and textbooks available
- The best short online tutorial: [[https://github.com/matloff/fasteR][Matloff's "fasteR"]]
- Beware of ideologies (cp. Matloff's "[[http://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][TidyverseSceptic]]")

* INTRODUCTION to GNU Emacs + ESS + Org-mode
#+attr_html: :width 200px
#+caption: GNU Emacs start page
[[../img/emacs.png]]

- Emacs: self-documenting, extensible /FOSS/ text editor
- Process, file and package management (like an OS)
- /Literate programming/ environment for 43 languages
- /IDE/ for R programming and /REPL/ for interactive coding

* LITERATE PROGRAMMING
#+attr_html: :width 500px
#+caption: What is literate programming?

- Common practice among data scientists
- /Paradigm/ behind interactive computing notebooks
- Useful when learning any programming language

* PRACTICE - COURSE INFRASTRUCTURE

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/ds1 and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

*Note:* Class room practice completion = 10 points each[fn:1].

* ASSIGNMENTS

- There are 15 programming assignments altogether = 10 points each[fn:2]

- Register with DataCamp and complete the DataCamp chapter
  [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1420][Introduction to data scienceâ€‹]] by Monday, 22 August at 11 am (ca. 20
  min). We'll deepen this treatment in a separate lecture.

  + Data science definition
  + Data science workflow
  + Application to real-world problems
  + Different professional data science roles

- [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1436][Complete the Emacs on-board tutorial]] and upload an edited copy to
  Canvas by Friday, 26 August at 11 am (ca. 60 min).

  + Get comfortable with Emacs keyboard bindings
  + Learn how to create, view, edit, save files
  + Learn how to insert a time stamp automatically

* Week 2: GETTING STARTED
* Introduction to data science
* The R Programming Language
* Footnotes

[fn:2]To get full points, you need to complete a DataCamp assignment
on time. Late submission costs you 1 point per day (i.e. 0 points
after 10 days). For non-DataCamp assignments you lose points for
incomplete submissions.

[fn:1]From the [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1539][Canvas assignment]]:
#+begin_quote
Practice: course infrastructure (see GitHub) - no submission. To be
completed in the classroom. If you actively participated in the
practice session and/or uploaded the completed practice file
(usually Org-mode, occasionally other file formats), you get full
points. If you missed a classroom session with a submittable
practice file, you can complete and submit it later.
#+end_quote

  #+name: abstract
   #+begin_quote
  We start by defining what data science is. We'll cover the data
  science workflow and how data science is applied to real-world
  problems. We'll finish the chapter by learning about different roles
  within the data science field.
