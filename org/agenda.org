* README 

  - DSC 105 covers the basics of data science with R, simple
    visualization and productivity tools
  - We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
    extension, and Org-mode for literate programming
  - For details on objectives, audience, grading, schedule, check the
    [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1/blob/piHome/org/syllabus.org][syllabus]] or the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][FAQ]] on GitHub.
  - This file contains a (dynamically updated) agenda for each
    session as well as some content.

* Week 1: Getting started
* TODO Entry test (not graded) - 20 questions

- You get 10 points for completing this ungraded test
- All other tests (1-14) are graded
- Tests have to be completed online, are timed, and have a deadline

* TODO Course overview - syllabus (on GitHub and on Canvas)

- General information & standard policies
- Course information (grading, attendance)
- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1/blob/piHome/org/syllabus.org#classroom-sessions-schedule][Schedule]] with dates of tests and assignments
- The [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1][GitHub repo]] contains course material

* TODO Introduction to DataCamp (some assignments)

#+attr_html: :width 300px

[[../img/datacamp.png]]

- DataCamp is a data science learning platform
- Access for you is free (classroom license)
- 9/15 assignments are DataCamp assignments
- Assignments are drawn from 4 courses
  1. Data science for everyone
  2. Introduction to R
  3. Data visualization with R
  4. Introduction to data visualization with ggplot2
- Complete them on time to get full points
- Completed DataCamp courses can [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/birkenkrahe/][support your resume]]
  
* TODO Introduction to the textbook

#+attr_html: :width 200px
#+caption: Cover of Book of R (Davies, 2016)
[[../img/bookofR.png]]

- R is FOSS with focus on stats and graphics
- Davies' "[[https://nostarch.com/bookofr][Book of R]]" is extensive (832p.)
- You don't have to read along but it might help
- Many other tutorials and textbooks available
- The best short online tutorial: [[https://github.com/matloff/fasteR][Matloff's "fasteR"]]
- Beware of ideologies (cp. Matloff's "[[http://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][TidyverseSceptic]]")

* TODO Introduction to GNU Emacs + ESS + Org-mode

#+attr_html: :width 200px
#+caption: GNU Emacs start page
[[../img/emacs.png]]
 
- Emacs: self-documenting, extensible FOSS text editor
- Process, file and package management (like an OS)
- Literate programming environment for 43 languages
- IDE for R programming and interactive coding

* TODO Literate Programming

#+attr_html: :width 500px

- Common practice among data scientists
- Paradigm behind interactive computing notebooks
- Useful when learning anything 

* TODO Practice - Course infrastructure

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/ds1 and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

*Note:* Class room practice completion = 10 points[fn:1].

* Footnotes

#+begin_quote
Practice: course infrastructure (see GitHub) - no submission. To be
completed in the classroom. If you actively participated in the
practice session and/or uploaded the completed practice file (usually
Org-mode, occasionally other file formats), you get full points. If
you missed a classroom session with a submittable practice file, you
can complete and submit it later.
