  extension, and Org-mode for literate programming

#+begin_quote
In DSC 105 (Introduction to data science), we'll start with R from
scratch - no need to prepare unless you want to. If you already took
DSC 101 in fall 2021, you do not need to take this course. If you took
DSC 205 in spring 2022, you will experience some repetition. Textbook:
Book of R, Part I (ch. 1-8), by T D Davies (NoStarch, 2016).

#+begin_notes
In London in 1962, the Beatles failed a major audition with music
producers, who commited a Type II statistical error: their null
hypothesis was that guitar groups are no longer popular, and should
have been rejected.
