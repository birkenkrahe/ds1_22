- DSC 105 covers the basics of data science with R, simple
  visualization and productivity tools
- We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
  extension, and Org-mode for literate programming

#+begin_quote
"In DSC 105 (Introduction to data science), we'll start with R from
scratch - no need to prepare unless you want to. If you already took
DSC 101 in fall 2021, you do not need to take this course. If you took
DSC 205 in spring 2022, you will experience some repetition. Textbook:
Book of R, Part I (ch. 1-8), by T D Davies (NoStarch, 2016)."
#+end_quote

- General preparation: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-prepare-for-your-data-science-classes][see the FAQ]] - R, Emacs + ESS + Org-mode

#+begin_notes
In London in 1962, the Beatles failed a major audition with music
producers, who committed a Type II statistical error: their null
hypothesis was that guitar groups are no longer popular, and should
have been rejected.

** Practice - course infrastructure

*IF YOU ALREADY DID THIS IN ANOTHER CLASS: FINISH THE EMACS TUTORIAL!*

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
nexercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/dviz and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

Note: Class room practice completion = 10 points each for active
participation (if there's a practice file, you can make up).

- Assignment must be completed on time on [[https://app.datacamp.com/groups/lyon-college-data-science-fall-2022/assignments][DataCamp]]
- You loose 1 point for every day of late submission
- Canvas Gradebook is updated manually (with some delay)

** DONE Team projects - check in
#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[../img/scrum.jpg]]

- Course has grown to 15 participants!
- You'll have to do the project in a team - 2 to 3 people
- I can only accommodate at most 9 projects (last week of term)
- Put your team/ideas into this table ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/pages/enter-your-project-idea-and-participants-here][Canvas]]) by Wednesday

- [X] *Who has not yet found a team?*
- [X] *Who has a team but no idea what to do?*

** DONE DataCamp assignment: What Is Data Science?

- Data science definition biased towards Machine Learning
  #+attr_html: :width 600px

[[../img/power.png]]

- What do you think about the claim:

  /"Programming languages are like power tools"/

- What follows if this claim is true? What if it isn't?

** DONE [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1/blob/piHome/pdf/1_skills.pdf][What are your skills? (Mon 22-Aug)]]

** DONE 1st sprint review - Wed 31-Aug

- [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1438][Canvas assignment with submission]]

- Complete [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/pages/enter-your-project-idea-and-participants-here][projects overview table]] in Canvas *today*!

- If you are in > 1 course, you can use the same project idea!

** DONE Test 2 open ("What is data science?")

** DONE Project idea: compare base-R and "Tidyverse"

- Base-R is the foundation software from CRAN (the one you're using)
- "Tidyverse" is a popular bundle of packages (like ~dplyr~)
- The project would consist of comparing both with examples, along the
  lines of Matloff's "[[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][TidyverseSceptic]]" essay (see also recent [[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic/blob/master/RDesign.pdf][update]])

** Review: [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1452][test 2 - what is data science?]]

- *Which skills are relevant for data science?*
  + Customer service skills is a general people skill, not specific to
    data science
  + Database management is a general IT skill, not specific to data
    science
  + "Sales knowledge" is domain knowledge, and actually not a skill
P    (bad phrasing of the question on my part)
  + All skills and all knowledge can of course be brought to bear on
    data science, which means this is not a very well focused question

- *Which of these are part of the typical data science process?*
  + The typical data science process does not involve "machine
    learning" (ML). ML is a specific data science application.
  + Coding is a skill

- Data science as a *discipline* is neither very immature (undefined)
  nor very mature (standardized). It's changing so fast that its
  "maturity" is difficult to assess

- *Purpose of Scrum:* team and customer happiness are not suitable
  goals, because 'happiness' is highly subjective - too hard to define
  and measure (it's marketing and sales lingo)

- *Coding*, though still relevant and important, is no longer the most
  important skill for data scientists

* Week 4

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/emacsorg.png]]

* DONE Review: test 3 - getting started with R

- What does ~help(x)~ do in R?
  - To access web pages on a device that device needs to run a web server
  - Apache web server (FOSS)
  - XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/

- What type of argument does ~install.packages~ require?
  - e.g. installing ~MASS~: ~install.packages("MASS")~

- What is the difference between ~Rscript~ and ~R CMD BATCH~?

* DONE Review: 1st sprint review
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/pitchers.png]]

- What is a *reference*? What do I have to reference?
  1) All sources (incl. personal comm., incl. software like R)
  2) *Author(s)*, *Date of publication*, *Place of publication*, *Title*
  3) References need to be consistent and complete
- What do you think of [[https://www.marktechpost.com/2022/08/14/top-data-visualization-tools-for-data-science-and-analytics/][this reference]] in particular?

- Excellent *questions* for other teams (Kim/Balah/Boogie):
  1) Where and how did you find your data?
  2) What was challenging about picking your topic?

* DONE Better next time!
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/1_scrum.png]]

- *SUMMARY:*
  1) deliver more than the bare minimum
  2) work systematically, gather and list your references
  3) split up the work if you work in a team
  4) ask me for support before the sprint review deadline
  5) reflect on your project process and project success

* DONE Review: DataCamp chapter "[[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1437][Vectors in R]]" (1)

The first part of the review deals with vector data types and names.

1) There is no "Boolean" type in R, but ~logical~ instead, e.g. for the
   value ~TRUE~. How can I show this?

   #+begin_src R
     class(TRUE)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : logical

2) How can I turn ~TRUE~ in a vector named ~bool~?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     bool
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] TRUE

3) How can I make sure it's a vector?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     is.vector(bool)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] TRUE

4) Is ~bool~ a named vector? How do I know?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     names(bool)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : NULL

5) If ~bool~ is not named, how can I name it?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     names(bool) <- "Nick"
     names(bool)
     bool
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "Nick"
   : Nick 
   : TRUE 

** Solutions

1) There is no "Boolean" type in R, but ~logical~ instead, e.g. for the
   value ~TRUE~. How can I show this?

   #+begin_src R
     class(TRUE)
   #+end_src

2) How can I turn ~TRUE~ in a vector named ~bool~?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     bool
     class(bool)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] TRUE
   : [1] "logical"

3) How can I make sure it's a vector?

   #+begin_src R
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     is.vector(bool)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : TRUE
  
4) Is ~bool~ a named vector? How do I know?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     names(bool)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : NULL

5) If ~bool~ is not named, how can I name it?
   
   #+begin_src R :results output
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     names(bool) <- "Joey"
     bool
     names(bool)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Joey 
   : TRUE 
   : [1] "Joey"
