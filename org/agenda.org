* README

- DSC 105 covers the basics of data science with R, simple
  visualization and productivity tools
- We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
  extension, and Org-mode for literate programming

#+begin_quote
"In DSC 105 (Introduction to data science), we'll start with R from
scratch - no need to prepare unless you want to. If you already took
DSC 101 in fall 2021, you do not need to take this course. If you took
DSC 205 in spring 2022, you will experience some repetition. Textbook:
Book of R, Part I (ch. 1-8), by T D Davies (NoStarch, 2016)."
#+end_quote

- General preparation: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-prepare-for-your-data-science-classes][see the FAQ]] - R, Emacs + ESS + Org-mode

#+begin_notes
In London in 1962, the Beatles failed a major audition with music
producers, who committed a Type II statistical error: their null
hypothesis was that guitar groups are no longer popular, and should
have been rejected.

** Practice - course infrastructure

*IF YOU ALREADY DID THIS IN ANOTHER CLASS: FINISH THE EMACS TUTORIAL!*

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
nexercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/dviz and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

Note: Class room practice completion = 10 points each for active
participation (if there's a practice file, you can make up).

- What do you think about the claim:

  /"Programming languages are like power tools"/

- What follows if this claim is true? What if it isn't?
