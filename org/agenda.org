"In DSC 105 (Introduction to data science), we'll start with R from
scratch - no need to prepare unless you want to. If you already took
DSC 101 in fall 2021, you do not need to take this course. If you took
DSC 205 in spring 2022, you will experience some repetition. Textbook:
Book of R, Part I (ch. 1-8), by T D Davies (NoStarch, 2016)."
#+end_quote

- General preparation: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-prepare-for-your-data-science-classes][see the FAQ]] - R, Emacs + ESS + Org-mode

#+begin_notes
In London in 1962, the Beatles failed a major audition with music
producers, who committed a Type II statistical error: their null
hypothesis was that guitar groups are no longer popular, and should
have been rejected.

** DataCamp assignment: What Is Data Science?

- Data science definition biased towards Machine Learning
  #+attr_html: :width 600px

[[../img/power.png]]

- What do you think about the claim:

  /"Programming languages are like power tools"/

- What follows if this claim is true? What if it isn't?

** [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1/blob/piHome/pdf/1_skills.pdf][What are your skills? (Mon 22-Aug)]]

** 1st sprint review - Wed 31-Aug

- Base-R is the foundation software from CRAN (the one you're using)
- "Tidyverse" is a popular bundle of packages (like ~dplyr~)
- The project would consist of comparing both with examples, along the
  lines of Matloff's "[[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][TidyverseSceptic]]" essay (see also recent [[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic/blob/master/RDesign.pdf][update]])

** Review: [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1452][test 2 - what is data science?]]

- *Which skills are relevant for data science?*
  + Customer service skills is a general people skill, not specific to
    data science
  + Database management is a general IT skill, not specific to data
    science
  + "Sales knowledge" is domain knowledge, and actually not a skill
P    (bad phrasing of the question on my part)
+ All skills and all knowledge can of course be brought to bear on
  data science, which means this is not a very well focused question

- *Which of these are part of the typical data science process?*
  + The typical data science process does not involve "machine
    learning" (ML). ML is a specific data science application.
  + Coding is a skill

- Data science as a *discipline* is neither very immature (undefined)
  nor very mature (standardized). It's changing so fast that its
  "maturity" is difficult to assess

- *Purpose of Scrum:* team and customer happiness are not suitable
  goals, because 'happiness' is highly subjective - too hard to define
  and measure (it's marketing and sales lingo)

- *Coding*, though still relevant and important, is no longer the most
  important skill for data scientists

** DONE Review: DataCamp chapter "[[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1437][Vectors in R]]" (1)

The first part of the review deals with vector data types and names.

1) There is no "Boolean" type in R, but ~logical~ instead, e.g. for the
   value ~TRUE~. How can I show this?

   #+begin_src R
     class(TRUE)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : logical

2) How can I turn ~TRUE~ in a vector named ~bool~?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     bool
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] TRUE

3) How can I make sure it's a vector?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     is.vector(bool)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] TRUE

4) Is ~bool~ a named vector? How do I know?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     names(bool)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : NULL

5) If ~bool~ is not named, how can I name it?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     bool <- c(TRUE)
     names(bool) <- "Nick"
     names(bool)
     bool
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "Nick"
   : Nick
   : TRUE

** NEXT DataCamp assignment: "[[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1439][Matrices in R]]" (Sept 14)
* Week 5: Vectors in R
#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[../img/5_workhorse.png]]

- [X] Review DataCamp vectors in R (2)
- [X] Featured applications: automation, Python, learning
- [X] Continued: Arithmetic in R (lecture/practice)
- [X] Review test 4 - arithmetic in R
- [X] Vectors in R

** Review: DataCamp chapter "Vectors in R" (2)

1) How can you add ~c(1,2,3)~ and ~c(4,5,6)~?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     ## save vectors as R objects (variables)
     foo <- c(1,2,3)
     bar <- c(4,5,6)

     ## add vectors as they are
     c(1,2,3) + c(4,5,6)

     ## add vectors as variables
     foo + bar

     ## add vectors by hand
     c(1 + 4, 2 + 5, 3 + 6)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 5 7 9
   : [1] 5 7 9
   : [1] 5 7 9

2) What happens if you add a named and an unnamed vector?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     foo <- c("i"= 1, "j" = 2, "k" = 3)
     bar <- c(4,5,6)
     names(foo)
     names(bar)
     foo + bar
     names(foo + bar)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "i" "j" "k"
   : NULL
   : i j k
   : 5 7 9
   : [1] "i" "j" "k"

   Adding vectors of different length:
   #+begin_src R :results output
     foo <- c(1,2)
     bar <- c(1,2,3,4)
     foo + bar
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 2 4 4 6

3) What is the result of comparing ~c(1,2,3)~ and ~c(4,5,6)~ using
   relational operators ~>~ and ~<~ ?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     c(1,2,3) > c(4,5,1)
     c(0,5,6) > c(1,2,3)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE
   : [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

4) How can you add the first and second value of ~baz <- c(2,2)~?

   Parentheses suggest that ~baz~ is a function - this is not it:
   #+begin_src R :results output
     baz(1) + baz(2)
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src R :results output
     baz <- c(2,2)
     baz[1] + baz[2]
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 4

5) What happens if you get it wrong, and you try to add a value that's
   not there?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     foo <- c(1)
     foo[1]
     foo[2]
     foo[1] + foo[2]
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 1
   : [1] NA
   : [1] NA

6) What does ~qux[c(1:3)]~ mean?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     qux <- c(10,100,1000)
     qux[1]; qux[2]; qux[3] # print individual values
     qux[c(1,2,3)]  # print values using index vector
     qux[c(1:3)]
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 10
   : [1] 100
   : [1] 1000
   : [1]   10  100 1000
   : [1]   10  100 1000

7) How can you extract elements from ~qux~ that are greater than 100?

   #+begin_src R :results output
     qux <- c(10,100,1000)

     ## This generates an index or selection vector
     qux > 100

     ## Values of qux greater than 100
     qux[qux > 100]

     ## same as
     qux[c(F,F,T)]

     ## Index of extracted values
     which(qux > 100)

     qux[which(qux>100)] # resolves to qux[3]
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE
   : [1] 1000
   : [1] 1000
   : [1] 3
   : [1] 1000

1) Understand how you learn and choose resources that support your
   *learning style*
2) Set your own *incentives* and *goals* that you like and stage them as
   stepping stones
3) Learn from the *best* - check competence of authors, e.g. to learn a
   language, grab the book written by the author[fn:1], and study
   conventions of great programmers in that language[fn:2].

** Featured application: S

- John M. Chambers: S, R, and Data Science ([[https://youtu.be/qWG_MLrxKps][video]])
  #+attr_html: :width 400px

  #+begin_quote
  This talk discusses the history and characteristics of the R
  software. R began, 20-odd years ago, as the open-source clone of the
  S software. So the story of R has to start with S and with its
  history. S came from the Statistics and Data Analysis Research group
  at AT&T Bell Labs. We'll see that the design goal of S, and so of R,
  is to support studies in what we'd now call data science. The
  principles resulting from this goal are still central to computing
  for data science.
  #+end_quote

- Development of S was influenced by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)][APL ("A Programming Language")]],
  whose central data structure is the multi-dimensional array. What
  does the APL logo remind you of?

** DataCamp deal - mid-term miracle
#+attr_html: :width 300px
[[../img/miracle.jpg]]

- It's a mid-term miracle! You can complete missing DataCamp lessons
  by Friday, Sept 30, 12 pm for 50% of the points! Alleluiah!

- This course is all about *getting the skills*, not about getting the
  certificate(s) or the grades (though these are nice to have, too).

- The next DataCamp assignment ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1439][Matrices in R]]) postponed by 1 week

- The next 2-3 assignments will be independent sets of exercises to be
  completed in and submitted as Org-mode files - [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/2952][1st assignment today!]]

** Review: creating, sorting, measuring vectors

1) How many parameters does ~options()~ have?
   #+begin_src R
     is.vector(options()) # though technically a list object, also a vector
     length(options())  # vectors (and lists) have a length
   #+end_src
2) How can you create a vector ~foo~ with: 1, b, TRUE
   #+begin_src R
     foo <- c(1,"b",TRUE) # vectors must have ONE data type only
     foo
     class(foo) # foo is coerced into a character vector
   #+end_src
3) How can you create a vector ~bar~ with: 2,2,3,3,2,2,3,3,456,78,79,80
   #+begin_src R
     bar <- c(
       c(2,2,3,3,2,2,3,3,456,78,79,80),
       c(rep(c(2,3), times=2, each=2), 456, 78:80),
       c(rep(c(2,3), times=2, each=2), as.integer("456"), seq(78,80))
     )
     identical(bar[1:12],bar[13:24])
     identical(bar[13:24],bar[25:36])
   #+end_src
4) What is the default order of ~sort~? How can you change it?
5) What is the length of ~c(1,34.5,rep(1,2,2),5*100,8:10)~
   #+begin_src R
     baz <- c(1,34.5,rep(1,2,2),5*100,8:10)
     baz
     length(baz)
     rep(1,2,2)
     rep(x=1,times=2,length.out=2) # length.out = desired length
     rep(x=1,times=2,each=2)
     rep(x=1,times=2,length.out=NA,each=2)
   #+end_src

     rbind(c(1,2),c("a","b"))
     cbind(c(1,"a"),c(2,"b"))  # not recommended - mixed data types
   #+end_src

3) What R data type/object is ~rbind(1, "Archipel Gulag")~ (and what
   does "Archipel Gulag" mean?)
   #+begin_src R
     rb <- rbind(1,"Archipel Gulag")
     rb
     is.vector(rb)
     is.matrix(rb)
     is.numeric(rb)
     is.character(rb)
   #+end_src

4) What R object is ~c(1,2) == c(1,2)~, what's the result and why?
   #+begin_src R
     c(1,2) == c(1,2) # the result is a 2-element logical vector because
                                             # every element of each vector is compared with its
                                             # opposite number
   #+end_src

5) What is ~matrix(c(c(1,2)))~ - what is ~matrix(c(1, c(1,2)))~?
   #+begin_src R
     m1 <- matrix(c(c(1,2)))   # c(c(1,2)) is c(1,2)
     m2 <- matrix(c(1, c(1,2)))  # one-dimensional matrix
     c(c(1,2))
     c(1,c(1,2))
     m1
     m2
     dim(m2)
   #+end_src

6) How do you extract elements from ~qux <- c(10,100,1000)~ that are
   greater or equal than 100 (without doing it manually)?
   #+begin_src R
     qux <- c(10,100,1000)   # define vector
     qux[qux >= 100]         # logical index vector
     qux[which(qux >= 100)]  # indices extracted with which()

     which(qux>=100)  # index vector - indices for F T T
     qux >= 100     # logical vector F T T

     qux[(qux >= 100) + 1] # extracts elements (F,T,T)+1=(T,T,T)
     qux[which(qux >= 100) + 1] # extracts elements (3,4)
   #+end_src

7) In R, what is ~(-8)^(1/3)~
   #+begin_src R
     (-8)^(1/3)
   #+end_src

   Which command extracts the names like this:
   #+begin_example R
   : [1] "A New Hope"              "The Empire Strikes Back"
   : [3] "Return of the Jedi"
   #+end_example

   #+begin_src R
     star_wars <- cbind(
       "US" = c(460.998,290.475,309.306),
       "non-US" = c(314.4,247.9,165.8))

     rownames(star_wars) <- c("A New Hope",
                              "The Empire Strikes Back",
                              "Return of the Jedi")
     star_wars
     rownames(star_wars)
   #+end_src

** Review test 6 - creating, sorting, measuring

1) What is the difference between:
   - ~options~
   - ~options()~
   - ~names(options())~

   #+begin_src R
     str(options)  # a function - needs an argument
     is.vector(options()) # a non-atomic vector (and a list)
     head(options(),1)
     class(names(options()))
     head(names(options()),2)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : function (...)
   : [1] TRUE
   : $add.smooth
   : [1] TRUE
   : [1] "character"
   : [1] "add.smooth"        "browserNLdisabled"

2) What is ~letters~ and what data type is ~length(letters)~?
   #+begin_src R
     letters
     length(letters)
     dim(letters)   # this is NULL for vectors
   #+end_src

3) What is ~c(TRUE, FALSE, 2)~
   #+begin_src R
     c(TRUE,FALSE,2) #coerced into a numeric vector
     class(c(TRUE,FALSE,2))
     2 == TRUE
     1 == TRUE    # internal representation of Booleans
     0 == FALSE
     T == TRUE    # short cut
     F == FALSE
   #+end_src

4) What type of vector is ~c(FALSE, "Lyon", Inf)~
   #+begin_src R
     c(FALSE, "Lyon", Inf)
     is.character(c(FALSE, "Lyon", Inf))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "FALSE" "Lyon"  "Inf"
   : [1] TRUE

5) How can you create a vector ~"a" "b" "c" "a" "b" "c"~
   #+begin_src R
     c("a", "b","c", "a", "b", "c")
     rep(letters[1:3], times=2)
     rep(c("a","b","c"), times=2)
   #+end_src

6) Which command reverses ~x <- seq(from=1,to=3.6, by=0.5)~
   #+begin_src R
     x <- seq(from=1,to=3.6, by=0.5)
     x
                                             #     seq(from=3.6,to=1, by=0.5)
     seq(from=3.6,to=1, by=-0.5)
     sort(x, decreasing=TRUE)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5
   : [1] 3.6 3.1 2.6 2.1 1.6 1.1
   : [1] 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0

7) What is the length of ~c(3e+1, rep(5,10, 5))~. NOTE: this question
   was malformatted: ~rep(from=5, times=10, 5)~ is just confusing and it
   is odd that R would accept it at all...
   #+begin_src R
     ## default behavior:
     ## rep(x, times = 1, length.out = NA, each = 1)
     rep(5,10,5) # x = 5, times = 10, length.out = 5
     rep(x=5,times=10, length.out=5)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 5 5 5 5 5
   : [1] 5 5 5 5 5

8) If ~x <- c(1,2)~ What is

   #+begin_src R
     x <- c(1,2); x; names(x)
     names(x) <- c("1",NA); x
     names(x) <- c("1",""); x
   #+end_src

9) What types are the rows and columns of this data frame? What are
   their names?
   #+begin_example R
             jane joe   jim
     janet      1   a  TRUE
     jackson    2   b FALSE
     jordan     3   c FALSE
   #+end_example
   #+begin_src R
     df <- data.frame(
       "jane"=1:3,
       "joe"=letters[1:3],
       "jim"=c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE))
     rownames(df) <- c("janet","jackson","jordan")
     df
     names(df$"joe")
     colnames(df)
     colnames(df[2])
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :         jane joe   jim

   : NULL
   : [1] "jane" "joe"  "jim"
   : [1] "joe"

** Review naming vectors and indexing

- [ ] The open question from Monday - how to fix ~bar~? The problem:
  ~names(bar)[6:7]~ should only overwrite two elements of ~names(bar)~,
  but instead the elements 1:5 were missing!
  #+begin_src R
    week <- c("Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun")
    foo <- seq(from=100, to=200, length.out=7)
    names(foo) <- week
    foo
    workweek <- week[-(6:7)]
    workweek
    names(foo) <- workweek
    names(foo)  # last two names are now missing
    names(foo)[6:7]
    names(foo)[6:7] <- week[6:7]
    foo
  #+end_src

    names(foo)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:

- [ ] How many ways are there to extract the elements 3 to 4 of this vector?
  #+begin_src R
    vec <- c("hundred"=100, "thousand"=1000, "fifty"=50, "five-hundred"=500)

** Review: 2nd sprint review
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/scrum.png]]

- Question (Hayden & Nick): »What do you do when you feel like you are
  starting to stall in progress towards your goal?«
  #+begin_notes
  My answer to your question: in an agile Scrum-like project, this is
  easy: contact me as the customer after analysing your issues and have
  a frank discussion. This opens up negotiations with the customer. Such
  negotiations may result in a modified goal or process, but they
  certainly will inject some needed energy. If the problem persists
  afterwards, external factors may play a role (e.g. other commitments).
  #+end_notes

- Questions (Jackson):
  1) Wide or narrow focus (e.g. special players or whole league)
     #+begin_notes
     It depends on your question, on the validity of the data, on the
     size of the sample(s), and on what others have done before you
     (which also indicates a pattern of questions interesting to
     others)
     #+end_notes
  2) Are we far enough in our project yet (in comparison with others)?
     #+begin_notes
     No reason to worry about relative progress: I am not grading on a
     curve. Some projects are further along than others, and my
     comments will reflect that. Projects with literature review and
     with very specific, clear questions (or sub-questions) are
     generally further along.
     #+end_notes
  3) Is the topic too broad? Should we take fewer variables?
     #+begin_notes
     For exploration, always download/save as much data as you can. I
     like to build up my exploration from small scenarios: work from
     interesting questions, not from raw data. This is a better way to
     get to know the data. Also, again: other people's related
     investigations may give you interesting insights.
     #+end_notes

- Whatever you do, you should comment on your choices and reflect
  minimally at least on what your options were and why you chose them.

- Is there a specific dress code?  Answer: no, but you should always strive to look "professional" (this means adapted to the occasion - possible check with someone)

- [ ] Open an Org-mode file in Emacs for R code blocks to code along:
  on the (Windows) command line, enter ~emacs --file factor.org~ to load
  the file into the 1st buffer (it'll be created if it doesn't exist).

- [ ] In ~factor.org~ insert any of your other R coding files with ~C-x i~
  followed by the file name. This will give you the necessary header.

- [ ] Run *each* header line to activate it and start an R session ~*R*~
  (run with ~C-c C-c~, resulting in: /"Local setup has been refreshed"/)

- [ ] Delete all lines below the header lines by going to the first
  character with your cursor, set the mark (~C-x SPC~), expand region to
  EOF (~M->~) and delete (~DEL~). Now your Emacs buffer should look like
  this: like this:
  #+attr_html: :width 500px

- [ ] What is the format of the ~factor~ function? How can you find out?
  #+begin_example R
  factor(x = character(),      # character vector data
         levels,           # optional vector of unique values
         labels = levels,
         exclude = NA,
         ordered = is.ordered(x),
         nmax = NA)
  #+end_example
- [ ] How can you find out what the definition of ~factor~ is?
  #+begin_example R
  str(factor) # structure of the function object
  help(factor) # online help with examples: quit process with C-g
  factor # prints function definition
  #+end_example
- [ ] How can you find out what all these options really mean?
  #+begin_src R
    example(factor)
  #+end_src
- [ ] Create a ~character~ vector ~answers~ from investors, with the
  values: {stock, bond, bond, stock}
  #+begin_src R
    answers <- c("stock","bond","bond","stock")
    answers
  #+end_src
- [ ] Create a variable ~investment~ from ~answers~ using ~factor~ and check
  if it is ordered and named
  #+begin_src R
    investment <- factor(answers)
    investment
    is.ordered(investment)
    names(investment)
  #+end_src
- [ ] Where do the ~integer~ values in ~str(investment)~ come from?
  #+begin_src R
    str(investment)  # structure of the factor vector
    as.integer(investment)   # integer values of the vector variable values
    str(ToothGrowth)        # another example: a data frame
    as.integer(ToothGrowth$supp)   # integer values of the factor variable values
  #+end_src
- [ ] How would you order ~investment~ so that "bonds" are less than
  "stocks"?
  #+begin_src R
    i1 <- factor(answers, order=TRUE)
    i1
    is.ordered(i1)
    str(i1)
    summary(i1)  # the statistical summary is a contingency table
  #+end_src
- [ ] How would you order ~investment~ so that "stocks" are less than
  "bonds"?
  #+begin_src R
    answers
    i2 <- factor(answers,
                 levels=c("stocks","bonds"),
                 ordered=TRUE)
    str(i2)
    summary(i2)
  #+end_src
- [ ] Why are ~NA~ introduced by coercion?
  #+begin_notes
  Because the character strings cannot be properly formatted as
  numeric values. Notice that there is no warning!
  #+end_notes
  #+begin_src R
    as.numeric(i2)
  #+end_src

** I can teach it to you but I can't learn it for you
#+attr_html: :width 600px
#+caption: Prof Dr Gerhard Mack (2018)
[[../img/mack1.png]]

- Some of y'all's difficulties reminded me of this diary post:
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/diary.org#i-can-teach-it-to-you-but-i-cannot-learn-it-for-you]["I can teach it to you but I can't learn it for you."]]

- I remember this from my own studies: it was always dangerous to
  learn from a brilliant teacher (of which I had a few) because I
  mistook his competence for my own! His teaching usually put me into
  a trance: everything seemed to make sense and I understood it all!

- It is only when I tried to solve similar problems on my own
  afterwards, completely by myself, and failed miserably more often
  than not, that I understood the difference between learning
  something FROM someone else (which isn't really possible), and
  learning it BY yourself (which really is the only way of learning
  anything).

** Review of the review: data frames [DataCamp]
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/df1.png]]

*Recall what we did last time and test your memory/understanding:*

- Can you alter built-in data frames like ~mtcars~?
  #+begin_src R
    data(mtcars)  # reload pristine data frame from the package
  #+end_src

- Can you add a column to a built-in data frame? For example, a column
  of ~NA~ values called ~missing~ to the ~mtcars~ data frame.
  #+begin_src R
    mtcars <- data.frame(mtcars,"missing"=NA)
    str(mtcars)
  #+end_src

- What if we mess up and overwrite a built-in data frame by mistake?
  #+begin_src R
    ## reload the original data set
    data(mtcars)
    str(mtcars)
  #+end_src

- How do you extract values from a data frame? (For example: what's
  the mileage ~mpg~ of the Honda Civic in the ~mtcars~ data set?)
  #+begin_src R
    mtcars["Honda Civic","mpg"]  # indexing with row and col names
  #+end_src

- How do you add another row to a data frame? (For example: add a row
  for my ~Kia Rio~ to ~mtcars~

  Let's remove the useless ~NA~ column "missing" first:
  #+begin_src R
    idx <- which(colnames(mtcars)=="missing")
    mtcars <- mtcars[,-idx]
    mtcars
  #+end_src

  Here are two alternative methods to do this:
  #+begin_src R
    mtcars <- mtcars[,-length(colnames(mtcars))]
    mtcars <- mtcars[,-ncol(mtcars)]
    mtcars
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src R
    data(mtcars)
  #+end_src

  Now add a new row:
  #+begin_src R
    nrow(mtcars)  # number of rows of the dataset
    mtcars <- rbind(mtcars,"Kia Rio"=NA)
    str(mtcars) # what will be different in this output?
    mtcars
  #+end_src

- How do you remove a row from a data frame?

  For example the ~Kia Rio~ row(s) from ~mtcars~?
  #+begin_src R
    mtcars <- mtcars[-(33:38),]
    mtcars
  #+end_src

- How do you (re)name rows of a data frame?

  For example the ~Honda Civic~ row to just ~Honda~?
  #+begin_src R
    idx <- which(rownames(mtcars)=="Honda Civic")
    rownames(mtcars)[idx] <- "Honda"
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src R
    rownames(mtcars)[19]
  #+end_src

*Let's continue with the remainder of the topics for data frames:* Open
the (partially filled) practice file in Emacs: [[https://tinyurl.com/mpes4wen][tinyurl.com/mpes4wen]]

*We will practice more on data frames next week after the short break*

** 3rd sprint review - write an abstract

Complete this review and submit it [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1441][in Canvas]] by Nov 2, 11 am!

Here is an example from my current publication project - you're the
research participants!

Your abstract should have no more than 300 words. My example has 350
words (with many references still missing) and could easily be pruned
to 300. [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/research/Abstract.org][The full abstract (work in progress) is here]].

1) "One or two sentences providing a basic *introduction* to the field,
   comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline."

   #+begin_quote
   Data science draws on computer science, statistics and domain
   knowledge. It is highly *interdisciplinary*, even more so than other
   related fields like business intelligence or artificial
   intelligence. This interdisciplinarity leads to its alleged
   'sexyness' (Davenport/Patil, 2012 and 2022) - it purports to be
   open to students from a wide variety of backgrounds - like biology
   or psychology, who are interested in widely different
   applications - like genome analysis or marketing predictions (???).
   #+end_quote

2) "Two or three sentences of more detailed *background*, comprehensive
   to scientists in related disciplines."

   #+begin_quote
   This versatility comes at a price: the beginner's learning path in
   data science is highly fragmented - it involves different
   programming languages, data visualization techniques, mathematical
   and process modeling, and knowledge of computing infrastructure
   (???).
   #+end_quote

3) "One sentence clearly stating the general *problem* being addressed
   by this particular study." (And how it was addressed.)

   #+begin_quote
   The problem is how to get enough of an overview of all of these
   aspects while learning about data science to solve real-world
   problems, especially for absolute beginners of data science
   (???). For this study, I have employed the (in computer science
   terms) ancient art of literate programming for instruction,
   interaction, and immersion in data science. To facilitate this
   triade of methods, the equally ancient text editor GNU Emacs with
   the ESS ('Emacs Speaks Statistics') and Org-mode plugins were used.
   #+end_quote

4) "Two or three sentences explaining what the main *result* reveals in
   direct comparison to what was thought to be the case previously, or
   how the main result adds to previous knowledge."

   #+begin_quote
   Data science teaching practice has focused on creating special
   tools like RStudio, a popular IDE for R, packages like the
   "Tidyverse", or online platforms like DataCamp to make learning
   data science (in this case via an R programming track) more
   palatable. Unfortunately, these parallel infrastructures achieve
   little when it comes to preparing students for the real world
   (???). The methodological attitude is well summarized by the "low
   code/no code" trend in IT (???).
   #+end_quote

5) "One or two sentences to put the results in a broader *context*."

   #+begin_quote
   We have used these methods for two consecutive terms across a
   spectrum of courses, with undergraduate students of varying
   seniority, background and interests at a small liberal arts
   college. The results were very encouraging, and contradict the
   current "no code/low code" trend in IT. In stark contrast, the
   study demonstrates that a "high road" approach mixing tools that
   are considered to be difficult but that deliver deep insights into
   both computing infrastructure and data processing, might be at
   least as successful if not more successful. Only followup studies
   can show if this hope will pan out.

** FYI - ggplot2 update

- Probably in an effort to sever ties with base R plotting completely,
  the "Tidyverse" folks have 'deprecated' ~qplot~ ([[https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2022/11/ggplot2-3-4-0/][Pedersen, 2022]])

- Deprecation means that there will be no further development efforts:
  over time, the function will cease to work properly

- Implications: do not use 'deprecated' functions for /productive
  environments/. (What's that?)

** Comments: 3rd sprint review (abstract/results)

Are you comfy? Rosie is.

- Only one person asked a question. This was still a sprint review, so
  although the abstract was the central deliverable, it's a customer
  contact.

- Give me an impression of your comfort or discomfort with the state
  of your own project, in particular with regard to the end! What do you want or need to know before the final presentation?

Questions:
- How can I make an Org-mode presentation look as cool as possible
- How can I best present in Org-mode
** Rendering HTML pages from Emacs Org-mode

1) Open one of your practice files (preferably with images) in Emacs
2) In the ~#+PROPERTY~ header, add the parameter ~:exports both~
3) Enter ~C-c C-e~ - this opens the ~Org Export Dispatcher~ dashboard
4) Enter ~h o RET~ to render the file in a browser
5) You can also export to WORD (OpenOffice), PDF, LaTeX etc.

** Easter egg - solution

I asked what these pieces of art have in common:
- Goya, The Clothed Maja (Madrid)
- Da Vinci, The Last Supper (Milan)
- van Gogh, Sunflowers (Louvre)
- Botticelli, La Primavera (Florence)

Kim Ho identified the commonality! Well done!

#+begin_quotes
The answer: these works of art have all been attacked in 2022 by
climate activists from the [[https://www.last-generation.org/]["Last Generation]]" group. This group attacks
public art with mashed potatoes, black paint, tomato soup etc. and the
attackers glue themselves to the wall shouting slogans until they are
taken away. Two more have been added to the list in the last 2 weeks:
- Klimt, Death and Life (Austria)
- Monet, Les Meules (Berlin)

[fn:3]Can you figure out the connection between the three paintings
selected for this term's final presentation announcement?

[fn:2]In the case of R, Norm Matloff is one of the greatest,
especially when it comes to parallelization of code, debugging, and
linking computer science and statistics, the author of a great
tutorial for beginners, [[https://github.com/matloff/fasteR][fasteR]]. Another one is Matt Dowle, the creator
of the [[https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table][data.table package]].

[fn:1] In the case of R, John Chambers is a good starting point. Check
out his book ([[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-75936-4][Chambers, 2008]]) and this [[https://youtu.be/qWG_MLrxKps][2021 webinar by him]] (90 min)
which is based on his 2020 article [[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3386334][S, R, and data science]].
