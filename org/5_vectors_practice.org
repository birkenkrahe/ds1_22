- Practice file for the lecture on "Vectors in R" ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1/blob/piHome/org/5_vectors.org][GitHub]])
- All content from "Vectors in R" is also available [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SfZh1-kWXl3_YDc-8SS5EuG4h1aILHz][on YouTube]]
- Create, execute and debug R code blocks as needed
- Emacs + ESS + Org-mode and R must be installed
- Upload the completed file as a class assignment ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/2952][Canvas]])

* TODO IDENTIFY YOURSELF

  - Update the ~#+AUTHOR:~ information in the header
  - Add ~(pledged)~ after your name
  - Put your cursor on the headline of this section, and type ~S <LEFT>~
    until you see ~DONE~ instead of ~TODO~ next to the title.
  - Perform this last step each time you complete a section.

* TODO Create and store a sequence

1) Create a sequence of values from ~5~ to ~-11~ that progresses in steps
   of ~0.3~.
2) Store the sequence as an object ~seq_vec~ and print it.

* TODO Reverse sequence order

Overwrite ~seq_vec~ from the last exercise, using the same sequence with
the order reversed.

* TODO Create vector by repetition

1) Repeat the vector ~c(-1,3,-5,7,-9)~ twice, with each element repeated
   ~10~ times

2) Store the result as ~rep_vec~.

3) Display the result sorted from largest to smallest.

* TODO Putting it all together, and measuring

Create and store a vector that contains, in any configuration, the
following:
   - A sequence of integers from ~6~ to ~12~ (inclusive)
   - A threefold repetition of the value ~5.3~
   - The number ~-3~
   - A sequence of nine values starting at ~102~ and ending at the
     number that is the total length of the vector ~rep_vec~ created
     earlier.
   - Confirm that the length of the vector created is ~20~
