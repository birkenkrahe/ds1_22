Borgia Apartment (Wikipedia).

*Sources:* Some material for this lesson comes from [[davies][Davies (2016)]] and
[[matloff][Matloff (2020)]]. These and other sources have been important to me in
preparing this course and getting into R int he first place. Check
them out for a more systematic treatment of R. There is also a more
philosophical, personal view on my use of sources [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds101/wiki/Why-R,-my-path,-DataCamp][in the Wiki]] for the
2020 version of this course.

*What is this?* When we say "Arithmetic", we don't mean that we "study"
numbers but that we use them to perform computations. After this
section, you'll be able to perform any arithmetic operation using R.

We will look at /operators/ first, then at simple but important
functions that occur again and again, especially in /statistics/.

*How can you learn better?* This presentation consists mostly of text
and code chunks. Because this is dry stuff, I urge you (both if you
hear this in class, and if you work through this on your own) to open
an R session on the side and type along - this will build muscle
memory and keep you entertained, too! Another trick, which you will
find in [[matloff][Matloff's excellent beginner's tutorial]], is to make your own
little exercises by varying the instructions. A third way is to go
through the lecture and create your own Emacs Org-mode notebook with R
code blocks.

*Operator order:*

1) *P* arentheses: ~()~
2) *E* xponentiation: ~^~ or ~**~
3) *M* ultiplication: ~*~
4) *D* ivision: ~/~
5) *A* ddition: ~+~
6) *S* ubtraction: ~-~

/Tip: You can check identity in R with the ~identical~ function./

#+begin_notes
In R, standard mathematical rules apply. The order of operators is as
usual - left to right, parentheses, exponents, multiplication,
division, addition, subtraction (PEMDAS = Please Excuse My Dear Aunt
Sally) mnemonic).

The operators ~^~ and ~**~ for exponentiation are identical, though ~^~ is
more common. You can check that in the R console with the ~identical~
function - the result should be ~TRUE~ (this is a truth or Boolean
value - more on this below) - see figure:

log10(1 * 10^7) = 7

log10(100) = 2 , log10(1000) = 3 , log10(1e3) = log10(1 * 10^3) = 3

log(1) = 0, log10(1) = 0

log(x=100,b=100) = 1 , log(4.583,4.583) = 1

#+begin_notes
It is often necessary to transform numerical data, e.g. transforming
data using the logarithm leading e.g. from the left to the right graph
in the figure. As you can see, this transformation leads to a
compression of the ~y~-values, so that more of these values can be
shown.

The /logarithm/ of a number ~x~ is always computed using a /base/ ~b~. In
the diagram, ~b=10~, the numbers on the ~x~ axis were transformed
using the ~log()~ function, the logarithm with base ~10~. The logarithm
of ~x=100~ to the base ~10~ is ~2~, because 10^2 = 100. In R,
~log(x=100,b=10) = 2~ (try this yourself!).

#+end_notes

* Logarithm rules

[[../img/4_rules.gif]]

- Argument ~x~ and base ~b~ must be positive
- For all x: ~log(x, b=x) = 1~ since only x^1 = x
- For all b: ~log(x=1, b) = 0~ since b^0 = 1

* Exponential function
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/4_euler.jpeg]]

- In R, ~log(x)~ implies ~b = e \approx 2.7182~

- In mathematics, the /Euler constant/ ~e~ is as magical as the other
  mysterious constants \pi, 0, 1 and i (the imaginary unit). There are
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)][different ways]] to arrive at its value of approximately
  2.718282. 

- The Wikipedia entry on ~e~ contains some fun stuff for nerds
  ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)#In_computer_culture][here]]). Apparently, /Steve Wozniak/ computed ~e~ to 116,000 digits on
  an "ancient" Apple II computer in /1981/!

- For now, we only care about the fact that $e$ is the base of the
  natural logarithm, denoted as ~ln~ or log_e(x).

* E-notation
#+NAME: fig:powers
#+ATTR_HTML: :height 400px
[[../img/4_powers-ten.png]]

#+begin_notes
You already know that the number of digits that is displayed by R can
be changed using the ~options()~ utility function. The default number of
digits displayed is 7.

In order to display values with many more digits than that - either
very large, or very small numbers, we use the scientific or
e-notation. In this notation, any number is expressed as a multiple
of 10.
#+end_notes

* E-xamples

[[../img/4_penguins.gif]]

- 10,0000 = ~10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10~ = 1 * 10^5 = ~1e+05~

- ~7.45678389e12~ = 7.45678389 * 10^12 = 745.678389 * 10^10

- ~exp(1)~ = e = ~271828182845e-11~ = 271828182845\times10^{-11}

* Practice: e-notation
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/practice.jpg]]

#+begin_notes
To get from the e-notation with exponent y or -y to the complete
number of digits, simply move the decimal point by y places to the
right or to the left, resp.

No information is lost even if R hides digits; e-notation is purely
to improve readability. Extra bits are stored by R

~Inf~, ~-Inf~ and ~NaN~ are special numbers.

- ~?Comparison~ etc.

* Special numbers

#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/4_special.jpg]]

- ~Inf~ for positive infinity (\infty)
- ~-Inf~ for negative infinity (-\infty)
- ~NaN~ for "not-a-number" (not displayable)
- ~NA~ for "not available" (missing value)

#+begin_notes
1) ~NA~ values are especially important when we clean data and must
   remove missing values. There are Boolean (logical) functions to
   test for special values.
2) Missing values can be created easily by doing "forbidden" stuff. An
   example is trying to compute the square root of a negative number,
   e.g. ~(-2)^(1/2)~. The result is a complex number (in this case the
   solution to the quadratic equation $xÂ²+1=0$, called the imaginary
   number $i$). You can also use the function ~is.na~ to test for
   missing values: compute ~is.nan(sqrt(-1))~ for example.

#+begin_notes
~TRUE~ and ~FALSE~ are reserved in R for logical values, and the variables
~T~ and ~F~ are already predefined. This can cause problems, because these
variable names are not reserved, i.e. you can redefine them. So better
stay away from saving time by using the short versions of these
values.
#+end_notes

* Practice: logical values
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/practice.jpg]]

* Logical operators

There are three logical operators in R:

~!~ for "/not/":  ~1 != 1~            

~&~ for "/and/":  ~(1==1) & (1==2)~   

~|~ for  "/or/": ~(1==2) ~| (1!=1)~ 

#+begin_notes

[[../img/4_logops.png]]

In the last command, we generated a ~FALSE~ value by comparing two
~FALSE~ values, which is the only way to make an ~|~ statement ~FALSE~.

* Concept summary
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/4_summary.jpg]]

- In R mathematical expressions are evaluated according to the
  /PEMDAS/ rule.

- The natural logarithm ln(x) is the inverse of the exponential
  function e^x.

- In the scientific or e-notation, numbers are expressed as positive
  or negative multiples of 10.

- Each positive or negative multiple shifts the digital point to the
  right or left, respectively.

- Infinity ~Inf~, not-a-number ~NaN~, and not available numbers ~NA~
  are /special values/ in R.

[fn:2]The log transformation uses "Covid-19, confirmed deaths"
data. In hindsight, I don't find the explanation in the text
particularly satisfying: "Plotted on a linear scale countries'
caseload seemed to rocket up out of nowhere. But plotted on a log
scale it became easy to see which countries were on the path to an
outbreak, and how far ahead or behind each one was, relative to the
others." I just don't see this information more clearly in the log
plot, do you?

[fn:1]I've recently been reminded [[https://bigthink.com/13-8/math-thinking/][through this article]] how important
it may be to be able to do computations without the help of
machines. Here are [[https://gauravvjn.quora.com/4-ways-to-calculate-Square-Root-without-using-inbuilt-functions-in-C-language-Interview-Puzzle][4 ways]] to compute ~sqrt~ in C (though not very
fast). In general: 1) using logarithms and exponentials
(sqrt(x)=e^{0.5 \times ln(x)}), 2) using successive approximate
numerical methods like [[https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NewtonsIteration.html][Newton's iteration]], 3) using modified long
division ([[https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-a-Square-Root-by-Hand#Finding_Square_Roots_Manually_sub][prime factorization]]), 4) [[https://www.mathworks.com/help/fixedpoint/ug/implement-fixed-point-square-root-using-lookup-table.html][looking it up in a table]] (source:
